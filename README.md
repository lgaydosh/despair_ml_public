Todd Dotson, 

Models be the end of the semester, paper by the end of the spring. 
Fewer people over a longer period of time.
Lot of code has been cleaned.

Most recent wave 5, predict wave 5, done in three random samples. Each sample is nationally representative. Roughly even. 
Done sequentially, period effect 2016, before election. Might be important diffences. 

Extension: other data sets from other PIs, want to harmonize. One option to build model on one set, apply to other. 

*NOTE*
Subset of data is publicly available. We'll want to consider, for later application of software to the public data. 

Interactive data, reproducible code
