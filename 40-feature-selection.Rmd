# @Marina - create combined function here which lets you choose which model to implement
# - look into how feature selection would work for the lasso regression model


# Get names of variables for top n predictors of random forest
# This should be called in the for loop after building the model on each bootstrap. 
# Save the result in a list - see example below
get_top_n_names <- function(model_h2o, top_n){
  # model_h2o: The h2o model object
  # top_n: The number of predictors to look at
  # return: data frame of variable importance
  
  # get names for top_n predictors
  out <- h2o.varimp(model_h2o)[1:top_n,1] %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>% 
    mutate_all(as.character)
  
  # add row_index
  out <- out %>% mutate(placement = as.numeric(rownames(out)))
  
  # rename the period as variable name
  names(out) <- c("variable", "placement")
  
  # return top_n predictors 
  return(out)
}

# Example
# h2o_model_list[[i]] <- h2o_model %>% get_top_n_names(top_n = 50) %>% as_tibble()
