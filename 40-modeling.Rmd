# Modeling

Tools, like H2O, could be used here for high-speed model solutions and interactive model exploration. 

## Prepare data

We'll add features to the dataset based on the ideas from the group.



## Split data

Partition the data into training, validation and test sets.



## Run Models

Could do the epicycle process, dropping and adding features for better models.


## Find Top Predictors

Find the model that works the best for our data.
