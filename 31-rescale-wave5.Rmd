Problem here is that if changing the wave 5 data set, some variables have 5 unique number, however, they are not 1 to 4, so need to specify one by one.

h5id6g and h5id6i: 0 1 NA
h5ss0a, h5ss0b, h5ss0c and h5ss0d: 1 2 3 4 NA ************
h5pe1, h5pe2 and h5pe3: 1 2 3 4 5 NA


Goal: Rescale Wave 5 variables to range [0-3] instead of [1-4] to match other wave variable ranges
```{r}
change_scale <- function(df, col_name){
 
  df <- within(df, {
    f <- col_name == 1
    col_name[f] <- 0
    
    f <- col_name == 2
    col_name[f] <- 1
    
    f <- col_name == 3
    col_name[f] <- 2
    
    f <- col_name == 4
    col_name[f] <- 3
  })
  
  return(df$col_name)
}

# Change on wave5$H5SS0A

wave5$H5SS0A <- change_scale(wave5,wave5$H5SS0A)
wave5$H5SS0B <- change_scale(wave5,wave5$H5SS0B)
wave5$H5SS0C <- change_scale(wave5,wave5$H5SS0C)
wave5$H5SS0D <- change_scale(wave5,wave5$H5SS0D)
```
