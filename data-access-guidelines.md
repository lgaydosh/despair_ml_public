## Do’s and Don’ts

### Dos

1.  Use ACCRE for AddHealth data access from an approved device
2.  Use Vanderbilt’s Pulse Secure VPN to remotely access the data through ACCRE
3.  Keep track of laptops and don’t leave them without supervision out in a public area
4.  Immediately lock the computer when you step away from your computer (Win + L)
5.  Make sure views of monitors are blocked while working with data (i.e., no one can look over your shoulder and see the data)
6.  Use an alternate login profile (e.g., Guest) when allowing other people to use your computer
7.  Contact VUIT via helpdesk ticket if your computer begins behaving strangely (e.g., a filename changed and you didn’t change it, computer has strange or unusual behavior)
8.  Report unauthorized identification of subjects immediately to project PI

### Don’ts

1.  **Never** let unauthorized users access or view the AddHealth data
2.  **Never** attempt to identify specific individuals or families
3.  **Never** make a physical copy of the data (e.g., never burn it to disk) or print it
4.  **Never** make an electronic copy of the data and store it outside of the approved VU1file share
5.  **Never** make a copy of the data and store it on your local computer
6. **Never** check a html notebook into the repository which contains raw data (e.g., the output of the `head` or `tail` function)
