# Predicting Despair

## Motivation 

The average life expectancy in the United States has shown a downwards trend since 2014. This downwards trend is attributed to deaths from diseases of despair. 

Deaths that occur due to diseases of despair are known as [deaths of despair](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/2019/9/long-term-trends-in-deaths-of-despair). These can be classified into deaths from suicide,drug and alcohol poisoning, and alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis.  

## Objectives

Our objective is to use supervised machine learning techniques to predict the behaviors that are associated with despair which include suicidal ideation, drug abuse, illicit drug use, opioid use and problematic drinking. We also wish to compare these methods to traditional statistical methods that have been used in previous analyses. We wish to use these machine learning techniques as a way of exploring whether despair measures are relevant in predicting these behaviors. We also aim to investigate and measure similarity between the prediction of different behaviors, and explore whether these different behaviors have the same or similar predictors. 

## Data
For this project, we use the [Add Health](https://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth) data which is a nationally representative study investigating the causes of health and health-related behaviors of adolescents and their outcomes in young adulthood. The design of this study was set up to be multi-survey, multi-wave and interdisciplinary. The study aims to perform direct measurement of the social contexts of adolescent life and their effects on health and health behavior. This study is novel because it incorporates data with unprecedented racial and ethnic diversity, in addition to genetically informed sibling samples. It also incorporates samples from disabled populations.
