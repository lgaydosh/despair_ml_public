The purpose of this document is to perform feature selection for the models built in the file 50 series. 

```{r load libraries}
# These are the libraries needed to run code below
```

Convenience functions are smaller functions you can string together to make bigger functions. Use them liberally.
```{r convenience functions}

# This function is for subsetting the data by outcome and predictors
get_outcomes_df <- function(df, outcome, predictors){
  # df: dataframe that has all data in it
  # outcome: outcome variable of interest
  # predictor_vars: predictor variables of interest
  # returns: tibble with only outcome and predictors of interest
  
  # create tibble to return
 out <- df %>%
   dplyr::select(outcome, predictors)
 
 # return tibble
 return(out)
}

```

```{r tibble for the suicide outcome}

suicide_w5 <- suicidal_list[5] # suicide indicator from wave 5

# Tibble for first outcome with all of its predictors
suicide_df <- joined_waves %>%
  get_outcomes_df(outcome = suicide_w5, 
                  predictors = setdiff(predictor_list, "aid"))

```

```{r tibbles for different outcomes}
# Tibble for second outcome with all its predictors
marijuana_df <- joined_waves %>% 
  get_outcomes_df(outcome = "<outcome 2>", 
                  predictors = "<predictor variables for outcome 2>")

# Tibble for third outcome with all its predictors
alhocol_df <- joined_waves %>% 
  get_outcomes_df(outcome = "<outcome 3>", 
                  predictors = "<predictor variables for outcome 3>")
```
