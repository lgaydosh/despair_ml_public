The purpose of this meeting is to get updates on assigned tasks and plan next tasks

## Agenda
1. **Update Dr. Gaydosh on topics from last week**  
    - Rachel's presentation
    - Masters students divided work to execute
2. **Update repo with project milestones**  
    - 
3. **_Individual_ student updates on project board + PP work - make sure to address:**  
    - **What was the purpose of your efforts this week?**    
    - **How did you address/solve it?**  
    - **Results of efforts**  
    - **What issues did you run into?**  
    - **How can we help?**  
    - **What are your next steps?**  
    - Ali: imported files, joined data with inner_join, 9349 cases left, listed variables of interest by category
    - (cont.) explored variables by category, distribution of values, missingness - will go back to find missing labels
    - (cont.) question with varying scales, possible relabeling errors 
    - (cont.) heat map for correlations
    - Planned next steps: clean/refine visualizations, add comments, ...
    
   **Note:  make sure that you address these topics during demos.  They're important for everyone!**
4. **Feedback and recommendations for improving code and analysis**
    - For participants, keep everyone in wave 5 (omit those missing outcomes at first)
    - Constructed variable info is in codebook, check what variables are in there, e.g.c4var009 is scale of anxiety
    - Add more detailed comments
    - Create resuable function to see if a variable is present
    - Create list instead of directly entering variables into select()
    - Data is discrete, not continuous - consider when making graphs
    - General tip- don't treat it as a class, perform analysis
    - Put visualizations first, data summary after as backup for details
    - Descriptive variable names and axis labels are helpful
    
    
5. **Discuss student questions [inclusion of subjects (come with proposed solution)] with Dr. Gaydosh** 
6. **Proposal: project diary**
    - Document problems encountered during project

## Other notes
- **Please feel free to add cards to the `Backlog` and `Current sprint`**
