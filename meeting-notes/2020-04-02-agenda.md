    - Aggregator functions 
    - get_metrics returns data frame with key metrics like AUC, logloss, etc.
    - get_metrics_set returns metrics for several
    - plot_metric_set plots the compatrison with models
    - Future enhancement- make it selectable 
    - Ali: hyperparamenter tuning, should look at fewer (only the top ones)
