**Purpose**  
The purpose of this meeting is to get updates on assigned tasks and plan next tasks

## Agenda
1. **Status and orientation**
    - **Where we are**
    - framework and functions, exploration, models and variable importance
    - **Where we're going**
    - Bugs, EDA functions, experiments
    - **H2o and how we train**
    - Data, k folds, select one fold for validation
    - Early stopping, combat with external validation set
    - Hyperparameter tuning- make many models with diff hyperparam
    - Create final model- feature selection?
    - Further steps: "bugs," missing data and recoding, random forest, LASSO, expected levels, selecting model on metrics besides AUC
    
2. **_Individual_ student updates on project board - make sure to address:**  
    - **What was the purpose of your efforts this week?**    
    - **How did you address/solve it?**

    - **How can we help?**  
    - **What are your next steps?**    
   **Note:  make sure that you address these topics during demos.  They're important for everyone!**   
    - Ivestigated AIDs, new people appear somehow, just use wave I
    - Hyperparameter explorations
    - Box plots
    
3. **Feedback and recommendations for improving code and analysis**
    - see project board
    
## Other notes
- **Please feel free to add cards to the `Backlog` and `Current sprint`**
- **Feel free to close issues with commits**
