    - Figured out that they were dropping/losing levels (fct_expand could help)
    - Some types of missing may convey more info (like "chose not to answer")
    - But may not be useful for creating depression scale
    - Wave 5 has N/A systematically bc it only has N/A, not types of N/A like before
    - Rescale wave 5, down by 1
    - More descriptive notes in files, show thought process

3. **Feedback and recommendations for improving code and analysis**

    - "Epicycles of analysis"
    
5. **Update repo with project milestones**
    - See milestones and deadlines under issues
6. **Update repo with new assignments**
7. How to model
    - Goals: create good model of data (evaluating, model), feature engineering
    - Split data into training and testing sets
    - Select some models- in this case LASSO (GLM), random forests
    - Hyperparameters
    - K fold cross validation- split up training set into "folds" and test over them to pick the best (try k=5)
    - H2O has lots of metric outputs
    - Bootstraps (try 100 to 1000 but start with like 5)
    - Write inner loop, then wrap in bootstrap
    - Check about stratifying for splitting (also by age, sex, race in addition to outcome)
## Other notes
