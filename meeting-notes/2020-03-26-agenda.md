# Despair Meeting Agenda

March 26, 2020

**Purpose**  
The purpose of this meeting is to get updates on assigned tasks and plan next tasks

## Agenda
1. **Status and orientation**
    - About a month left to go
    - Stay focused, literate programming
    
2. **_Individual_ student updates on project board - make sure to address:**  
    - **What was the purpose of your efforts this week?**    
    - **How did you address/solve it?**  
    - **Results of efforts**  
    - **What issues did you run into?**  
    - **How can we help?**  
    - **What are your next steps?**    
   **Note:  make sure that you address these topics during demos.  They're important for everyone!**   
   
    - Done with amending Rmd names
    - Feature selection clarified
    - Worked on restructuring code into different "series"
    - Confusion matrix 

3. **Feedback and recommendations for improving code and analysis**
    - AUC looks too high for training set
    - Return top n parameters, should we include all of them?
    - Answering question of how relevant these factors are: see if they show up in most relevant variables AND/OR see how model performance changes when removing these variables
    - For a model that generalizes, do need to split up data
    - For reproduceability, good to use fewer predictor variables
    
    
4. **Status and future steps directions**
- 70-experiments: template for conducting experiments
- Functions be in x0 files to be used
- Adding demographic variables (including constructed)
- Create function to investigate properties of non-included subjects
- See current sprint card assignments

5. **Logistics**
    
## Other notes
- **Please feel free to add cards to the `Backlog` and `Current sprint`**
- **Feel free to close issues with commits**
