# Despair Meeting Agenda

February 20, 2020

**Purpose**  
The purpose of this meeting is to get updates on assigned tasks and plan next tasks

## Agenda
1. **Logistics**
    - **Repo rebase?  Challenges with merge conflicts?**
    - Notes: more descriptive commits
    - **Undergraduates - coding?**
2. **_Individual_ student updates on project board - make sure to address:**  
    - **What was the purpose of your efforts this week?**    
    - **How did you address/solve it?**  
    - **Results of efforts**  
    - **What issues did you run into?**  
    - **How can we help?**  
    - **What are your next steps?**    
   **Note:  make sure that you address these topics during demos.  They're important for everyone!**

3. **Feedback and recommendations for improving code and analysis**
    - Create general variables to make it more reusable
    - Tuning parameters - one way is to say not to split unless purity of node is improved
    - Documentation for outside use? Depends on audience and setting
    - Current output- lots of models
    - Next: use var imp in H2O, maybe add up reduction of loss
    - Aggregate features in top ten
    - Still need to add demographic features (age at wave 5 only) and rescale wave 5 variables
    - Think about how to generalize approach to lasso
    
    - Assert statements (Assertr package): no repeated entries, check value ranges, other relevant
    - After feature engineering, good check
    
    - Behavior of joins - go back and check the antijoins and semijoins
    
## Other notes
- **Please feel free to add cards to the `Backlog` and `Current sprint`**
- **Feel free to close issues with commits**
