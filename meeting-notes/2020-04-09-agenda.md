   **Note:  make sure that you address these topics during demos.  They're important for everyone!**   
    
    -20 series: EDA for depression and anxiety, correlation matrix for depression, more updates next week now that know how to use repo, comparing anxiety between waves and seeing who changed answers, explore people who had anxiety in 5 but not 4
    - No need to move in the direction of redefining anxiety since that's already redefined
    -40 series: visualizations
    - Class imbalances- exploring preferences of number of trees, number of variables, and depth; some models seem undertrained; different thresholds - more consideration
    - Some AIDs in later waves but not wave I, looks like Wave I data missing a few cases, will investigate
    - Permutation settings- how much a variable is adding to model, functions to generate and visualize importance, considers variable type
    - Joins- investigated how many AIDs dropped in different comvinations
    
3. **Feedback and recommendations for improving code and analysis**
    - see project board
    
4. **Wrap-up and summer plans?**
    
## Other notes
- **Please feel free to add cards to the `Backlog` and `Current sprint`**
